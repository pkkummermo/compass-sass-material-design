independent-sass-material-design
================================

Simple package used for quickly getting up to speed to Googles Material Design. Primary goal is to supply simple functions to enhance already existing SASS code with basics such as colors, animations and simple elements.

#Requirements
You'll need the following for this package to work

- Ruby with Sass (>= 3.4.12) and Compass installed (>v1.0.3)

Optional (and recommended)

- Sass-lint (>=0.33.0)

#How-to
This project is using grunt, so if you're used to it you're good to go. Otherwise header over to http://gruntjs.com/getting-started to get your grunt fix.

- npm install
- grunt

#Possible improvements
- Awesome demo-page to show how easy (it should be) it is to use the collection
- Complete elements
- Complete list of ratios/paddings/margins and the lot
- Generated default css-file (this is what I want to avoid, but if it's needed it's needed)
